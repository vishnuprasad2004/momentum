# <img src="assets\images\logo-o-m.png" width="40px"> Momentum â€“ Smart Task Reminder App 

**Momentum is a task management app that goes beyond traditional to-do lists. Unlike standard apps where tasks get forgotten after the deadline, Momentum ensures you stay on track with AI-generated reminders inspired by Duolingoâ€™s notification system.**

### Challenges solved:  

I tried to solve a problem that arise with traditional task manager tools (todo apps) like notion, where you  do note them down but the software doesn't remind of those task and then they become irrelevant after the deadline is crossed. My app sends you remainders like duolingo to let you complete what to task is, I use AI to generate the messages (notification).
